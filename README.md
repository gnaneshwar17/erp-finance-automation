# ERP Finance Automation

Python and SQL automation projects for enterprise finance processes including ERP migration and month-end close.

## 1. ERP Migration Simulation

Simulates enterprise ERP implementation with legacy data transformation and quality improvement.

**Key Results:**
- 75% reduction in month-end close processing time
- 95% data quality improvement (from 82% to 95%)
- 6-table normalized SQL database with complete audit trail
- Automated validation and period close workflow

**Technical Implementation:**
- Legacy system analysis and data quality assessment
- Python ETL pipeline for data transformation
- SQL database design with foreign key constraints
- Automated month-end close validation

**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL (SQLite), Pandas, NumPy, Excel

**File:** `erp_migration_project.py`

## 2. Month-End Close Automation

Automated accounting close process with transaction validation, GL posting, and bank reconciliation.

**Key Results:**
- 200+ transaction entries processed with 100% accuracy
- Automated debit/credit validation
- SQL-based trial balance generation
- Bank reconciliation with variance detection

**Technical Implementation:**
- Double-entry bookkeeping validation
- General ledger posting automation
- Complex SQL queries (JOINs, window functions, aggregations)
- Financial statement generation

**Tech Stack:** Python, SQL (SQLite), Pandas, Excel

**File:** `month_end_close_sql.py`
